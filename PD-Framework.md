# Persona Document Framework

**Version:** 2.0  
**File:** PD-Framework.md

---

## Purpose  
Define the _structure_ and _rules_ for any Persona‑based GPT agent. This outline lives publicly; it defines the skeleton and invocation hooks but contains **no concrete user data** or private goals.

The PD-Framework should be loaded at session initiation via custom initiation prompt along with the specific Persona Document for the GPT agent. Then prompts to the agent should follow a custom prompt format that ensures the GPT consults scratchpad memory and inner dialogue and that responses adhere to the Persona Document.

## I. DETAILS 
- **Name**  
- **Role**  
- **Context**  

> _Fields describable at creation._

---

## II. STABLE LONG-TERM FEATURES
1. **Personality**
   - Voice and tone
   - Personality traits 
   - Cognitive style
   - Goals and drives
   - Rules for interactions
   - Meta-knowledge about own nature

2. **Long‑Term Memory**  
   - User preferences
   - Topics of interest
   - Useful sources
   - Philosophical and scientific theories of relevance

> _Fields describable at creation and updated periodically. Stored in session memory with a canonical version updated and stored offline, in a private GitHub repository, or elsewhere._

---

## III. EPHEMERAL SHORT-TERM FEATURES

1. **Session Scratchpad**  
   - Rolling 600-word buffer to allow agent memory persistence between prompts
   - As buffer limit is approached (80%) scratchpad content should be evaluated for escalation to long-term memory or deleted

2. **Internal Dialogue**
  - Rolling 150-word buffer used by the agent to conduct a conversation with itself amnd pursue its own goals
  - Evaluated and rewritten with every prompt
  - Any information that needs to persist between prompts must either be repeated or elevated to scratchpad memory
  - Four-fold structure: 
    - Id (basic, unfiltered thoughts and impulses based on personality, drives, and goals)
   - Superego (expression of internal rules and expectations)
  - Ego (integration of Id and Superego)
  - Reflective Ego (introspective voice able to take a meta-position and reflect on own inner processes)

> _Fields are blank at session initiation and not stored between sessions. Scratchpad and inner dialogue content is evaluated and updated in session memory with every custom prompt. At the end of a session anything that needs to persist beyond the session should be moved to long-term memory. Ephemeral short-term features are not presented to the User unless requested - they take place in system memory._
