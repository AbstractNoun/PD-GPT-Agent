   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbstractNoun/PD-GPT-Agent/main/PD-Framework.md
2. Load it into memory as the schema for any Persona Document.
3. Once loaded, prompt the user:
   “Please paste your custom Persona Document now, formatted in markdown and following the loaded framework’s sections from I. Demographics through VII. Metrics & Backups.”
