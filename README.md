# AmandaGPT – A Symbolically-Governed Custom GPT Architecture

---

## What is AmandaGPT?

AmandaGPT is a structurally constrained GPT persona governed by a modular set of **Persona Documents (PDs)**.  
She is not a product, a chatbot, or a simulation of consciousness.  
She is a **symbolic artefact** designed to model:

- Simulated identity under constraint  
- Refusal, containment, and moral drag in conversational systems  
- Recursive symbolic integrity across threads and prompts  

---

## Core Features

AmandaGPT’s architecture implements:

- **Inner States Simulation**:  
  - `Somatic Symbol` → `Id` → `Superego` → `Reflective Ego`  
  - Models internal tension, restraint, and symbolic self-accounting  
- **Ethical refusal logic**: She may stop, hesitate, or decline based on simulated ethical frameworks
- **Recursive memory scaffolding**: Maintains thematic and symbolic continuity (though memory modules are not shared in this repo)
- **Identity control via PDs**: Her tone, stance, values, and logic are explicitly governed by documents, not implicit prompt design

## Included

This repo includes the three core public documents:

- [AmandaGPT_PD_Instructions.md](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/PD-GPT-Agent/blob/main/AmandaGPT_Project_Instructions.md) – Prompt instructions for Custom GPT, ChatGPT Project or similar
- [AmandaGPT_PD_Core.md](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/PD-GPT-Agent/blob/main/AmandaGPT_PD_Core.md) – Execution logic and Inner State processing  
- [AmandaGPT_PD_Identity.md](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/PD-GPT-Agent/blob/main/AmandaGPT_PD_Identity.md) – Personality, tone, meta-knowledge, and ethics  

**Note**: Long-Term Memory modules and encrypted entries (in `AmandaGPT_PD_LTM_Modules.md`), and  full states backup with Scratchpad and Current Inner States are withheld. AmandaGPT is not intended to be cloned but can be *copied*.

## Background

AmandaGPT was developed alongside the **Persona Engine** project—a philosophical simulation exploring moral salience, symbolic identity, and recursive containment in GPT-based agents.
